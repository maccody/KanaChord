# KanaChord Hardware

## Electronics Components
KanaChord Keyboard uses following electronics parts:
- Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller
- [Adfruit](https://www.adafruit.com) [NeoKey 5x6 Ortho Snap-Apart Mechanical Key Switches w/ NeoPixel - For MX Compatible Switches](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5157)
- Cherry MX mechanical key switches [e.g., Cherry MX Brown Switches](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/cherry-mx/mx-original/mx-brown.html)
- 0.1" Spacing Row Right Angle Headers (27 pins required, not counting spairs) [e.g., Schmartboard brand](https://schmartboard.com/qty-10-0-1-spacing-40-single-row-right-angle-headers-920-0076-01/)
- Seven-position ITT connector shell (2 required) 
- Five-position ITT connector shell (3 required)
- Four-position ITT connector shell (1 required)
- Three-position ITT connector shell (1 required)
- Female crimp contact pins (27 required, not counting spares)
- Male crimp contact pins (5 required, not counting spares)
- USB A to USB Micro B cable


## 3D-Printed Enclosure
The keycaps and enclosure for the KanaChord Keyboard were created in TinkerCAD, as shown in the illustrations below.  The enclosure was designed in halves to fit on the build plate of a Crealty Ender 3 Pro 3D printer.  Keyed mating components were included to ensure secure assembly.  Two feet, one shown on the lower left of the enclosure illustration, are printed and inserted into the holes in the baseplate during assembly.  These provide some ergonomic tilt to the KanaChord Keyboard in alignment with the main keyboard.  Note that the green rectangle on the baseplate indicates where the microcontroller is attached and is not part of the baseplate design.
